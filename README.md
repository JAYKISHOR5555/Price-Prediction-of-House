# Price-Prediction-of-House
This project outline demonstrates a complete cycle of developing a machine learning model and deploying it in a production-ready environment AWS.

#Data understanding
We will use the California Housing Prices dataset, which contains historical data on housing prices in different areas. The dataset includes features such as:

longitude and latitude (location coordinates)
housing_median_age (age of the house)
total_rooms (number of rooms)
total_bedrooms (number of bedrooms)
median_income (income level in the area)
median_house_value (target variable)

#Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values (e.g., filling or dropping rows with missing data).

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Plot histograms to understand distributions.
Check for correlations between features
check outliers and remove 

#Feature Engineering:
Create new features like rooms_per_household.

#Model Selection
Choosing the algorithm: We'll start with Linear Regression and then explore more complex models if needed (e.g., Random Forest).
Feature scaling: Normalize the features for better performance

#Model Improvement
Try other models, such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, to see if performance improves

# Model Serialization
Save the model using joblib

#API Development for Model Inference
Create a Flask app (app.py)
test the API locally


# Dockerization
Create a Dockerfile:

#Cloud Deployment
Choose a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and set up a virtual machine or container service.
Deploy the Docker container on cloud services like:
AWS EC2 (Virtual Machine)

#Set Up Monitoring and Logging
Monitoring: Use cloud monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch) to track API performance and usage.
Logging: Implement logging for errors and prediction requests

#Setting Up a CI/CD Pipeline (Optional)
Automate the deployment process using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD.
This will allow for continuous integration and deployment when the code is updated
